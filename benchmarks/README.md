# Benchmark Suite

All scripts are found in and must be run from the `scripts` directory.

To run the benchmarks, you need to have the following tools installed for comparison:
- This tool's executable, generated by running `cargo build --release` or downloading from the "Releases" section.
- `seqtool`, available at <https://github.com/markschl/seqtool>.
- `seqkit`, available at <https://github.com/shenwei356/seqkit>.
- `grep`, available at <https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/>.
- `fetch_reads`, available at <https://github.com/voichek/fetch_reads_with_kmers>.
- `cookiecutter`, available at <https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter>.
- `back_to_sequences`, available at <https://github.com/pierrepeterlongo/back_to_sequences>.

Please ensure that the paths in the script `03-run-benchmarks.sh` point to the correct locations of the executables. 

Additionally, [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine) is needed to execute the runs. 

## Workflow

To download the data, run `./01-download-data.sh`.

To generate the query _k_-mers, run `./02-generate-patterns.sh`. This uses a seed to get reproducible results.

To start the benchmarks, run `./03-run-benchmarks.sh`.

To format the results, run `./04-format-results.sh`.

## Summary

A summary Markdown file of the result times is then found in `results/summary.md`.
